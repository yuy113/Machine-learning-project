Explore the algorithms in active learning and semi-supervised learning for classification
I explore some typical semi-supervised learning algorithms and active learning algorithms for the type of mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. 
I compare those active learning and semi-supervised learning algorithms with closely related supervised learning counterparts for classification 
on typical simulated sets and three real data sets with either binary or multi-classes labels.
