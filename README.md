Particle EM algorithm in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model

Develop a particle EM algorithm under the framework of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for text documents, and explore the global mode of evidence lower bound (ELBO) in Bayesian variational inference with penalized entropy for topic probabilities through generating multiple repulsive  particles to explore the search space to identify the comprehensive set of modes. 

Explore the algorithms in active learning and semi-supervised learning for classification

I explore some typical semi-supervised learning algorithms and active learning algorithms for the type of mixture of labeled and unlabeled data. I compare those active learning and semi-supervised learning algorithms with closely related supervised learning counterparts for classification on typical simulated sets and three real data sets with either binary or multi-classes labels.
