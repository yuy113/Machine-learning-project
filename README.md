Particle EM algorithm in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model

Develop a particle EM algorithm under the framework of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for text documents, and explore the global mode of evidence lower bound (ELBO) in Bayesian variational inference with penalized entropy for topic probabilities through generating multiple repulsive  particles to explore the search space to identify the comprehensive set of modes.
